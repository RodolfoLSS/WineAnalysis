# Wine Analysis

### Question 1  
Some winemakers have asked you to buy their wine. How would you exploit the data you have to estimate the best price to buy them?

### Question 2 
Since you will have customers from different countries, you want to create a wine list that presents wines from different parts of the world. How could you identify which areas are similar for production? Select the best wines from such areas to create the best wine list.
Please, take into account that you will have different types of customers, from wine lovers to wealthy people, able to invest an interesting amount of money in your bottles.
